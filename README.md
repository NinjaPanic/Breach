<p align="center">
<strong>
Breach is a silent Python-based backdoor crafted for stealth and persistence. Designed to run unobtrusively in the background, it establishes a hidden channel to receive remote commands and exfiltrate sensitive data. Leveraging encrypted communications and system-native techniques, Breach maintains access without triggering alerts. Its lightweight footprint and modular design allow seamless integration into compromised systems, ensuring long-term control and invisibility. You can give me a STAR ⭐ if you like my project.
To use it you have to download all requierement with the install.bat file and then start the build.py file. 
The old version technically works, but you would have to set up a DDNS, so you should use the new version with the Discord bot.
